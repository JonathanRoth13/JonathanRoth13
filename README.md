Hello, and welcome to my profile!

I am a fifth-year computer science student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I am particularly enthusiastic about artificial intelligence, computer vision, and data mining.

I will recieve my bachelors degree in computer science in June 2022. 

I have had two previous internships at Tyber Medical where I worked as a Business Intelligence Associate. I am grateful for the opportunity that I had to learn about medical device manufacturing and to be emerged in a professional environment.
 
I am passionate about the outdoors. There's nothing like being immersed in nature, surrounded only by wilderness and a few close friends.
