Hello, and welcome to my profile!
I graduated from RIT in May 2022 with a B.S. in computer science and I am currently working as an Associate Test Engineer at Amplify.
I am passionate about the outdoors. Thereâ€™s nothing like being immersed in nature, surrounded only by wilderness and a few close friends.
