Hello, and welcome to my profile!

I graduated from RIT in May of 2022 with a B.S. in computer science. I have professional experience in software development and business intelligence. I am particularly enthusiastic about artificial intelligence, computer vision, and data mining.

I have had two previous internships at Tyber Medical where I worked as a Business Intelligence Associate. I am grateful for the opportunity that I had to learn about medical device manufacturing and to be emerged in a professional environment.

I am passionate about the outdoors. Thereâ€™s nothing like being immersed in nature, surrounded only by wilderness and a few close friends.

I am seeking a full-time position in computer science, software engineering, data analytics, or related disciplines. Available May 2022.
