Hello, and welcome to my profile!

I am a fifth-year computer science student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I am particularly enthusiastic about artificial intelligence, computer vision, and data mining. I will receive my BS in Computer Science on May 7, 2022.

I have had two previous internships at Tyber Medical where I worked as a Business Intelligence Associate. I am grateful for the opportunity that I had to learn about medical device manufacturing and to be emerged in a professional environment.

I am passionate about the outdoors. Thereâ€™s nothing like being immersed in nature, surrounded only by wilderness and a few close friends.

I am seeking a full-time position in computer science, software engineering, data analytics, and related disciplines. Available May 2022.
